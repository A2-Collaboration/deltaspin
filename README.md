# Delta Spin Students' Experiment

Some little scripts and code to get the analysis of the data taken on
2015-01-10 running. You need CERN ROOT installed to use the macros.

To obtain the rawdata as GoAT trees, use the `download-rawdata.sh`
script by executing in this directory:
```
  ./download-rawdata.sh
```

Then take a look at the code snippets to work on those raw data trees.
